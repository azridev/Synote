[Synote](http://synote.org)
=================

Synote is a multimedia annotation system based on Web 2.0 and emerging Web 3.0 (semantic Web and linked data). In Synote note, you can:

* Listen to recordings whilst viewing the transcript and slides and making synchronised notes.
* Annotate only a certain part of audio-visual resources from all over the Web and share them online. 
* Automatically publish media fragments and annotations using Linked Data and they are searchable by Google. 
* Transcripts can be automatically uploaded via speech recognition if linked to this type of service (only for users of University of Southampton).

It's created and maintained by [Yunjia Li],[Dr Mike Wald] and EA Draffan at Web and Internet Science Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton.
